  abstract = {About 20\%-25\% of Caucasian individuals are nonsecretors who fail to express soluble A, B, H, and Lewis b histo-blood group antigens in secretory organs and secretory fluids because of the absence of the Secretor gene (FUT2)-encoded alpha(1,2)-fucosyltransferase (Se enzyme) activity. Recently, the FUT2 and a pseudogene have been isolated, and an Se enzyme-deficient allele (se) caused by a nonsense mutation (G428A, se1) in Caucasians has also been reported. Although we were unable to find the se1 allele, we have found a missense mutation (A385T, se2) and two nonsense mutations (C571T, se3 and C628T, se4) in the Japanese Se enzyme-deficient alleles. In addition, we have found a fusion gene, which consisted of the 5'-region of the pseudogene and the 3'-region of the functional FUT2, as a Se enzyme-deficient allele (se5). The DNA sequence analysis of the fusion gene indicated that the crossover region corresponded to regions between bases 253 and 313 of the pseudogene and between bases 211 and 271 of the FUT2. This finding suggested that the fusion gene was generated by homologous but unequal crossover. A population study on 141 randomly selected Japanese has indicated that the se2 is a common Se enzyme-deficient allele in the Japanese population. The results suggest that Se enzyme-deficient alleles are race specific.},

  abstract = {Maternal diet may affect human milk macronutrients, but it remains to be elucidated whether this is also influential in infant growth. This study aimed to examine (1) how maternal diet influences human milk macronutrients, and (2) to what extent the variation in milk macronutrients affects infant growth during the first month of life. In 71 Japanese lactating women, maternal dietary information was collected from the brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire, and anthropometry of mother--infant dyads was collected from medical records. Macronutrients in milk were analyzed by a Human Milk Analyzer. Maternal retinol intake was associated with the carbohydrate content in human milk at 1-month postpartum (standardized {$\beta$} coefficient: 0.287; p = 0.038). Moreover, the energy content in human milk was associated with an increase in the weight standard deviation score based on the WHO growth standard at 1 month of age (standardized {$\beta$} coefficient: 0.399; p = 0.046). Nevertheless, the milk macronutrient was not associated with the risk of infant growth abnormalities. In conclusion, a part of the maternal diet impacts macronutrient contents in human milk, but milk macronutrients have a limited effect on infant growth only within the normal growth curve during the first month of life.},

  abstract = {The heavy burden of maternal HIV infection has resulted in a high prevalence of premature birth and associated necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) were recently associated with HIV infection and transmission through breastfeeding and were also shown to reduce NEC in an animal model, particularly the HMO disialyllacto-N-tetraose (DSLNT). The primary aim of this study was to verify differences in HMO composition between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women. The secondary aim was to assess whether the HMO composition in the milk of mothers whose infants were diagnosed with NEC differs from that of mothers whose infants did not develop NEC. This study forms part of a larger clinical trial conducted at the Tygerberg Children's Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa, which recruited HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected mothers and their preterm infants ({$<$}34 wk gestation; {$\geq$}500 and {$\leq$}1250 g). Eighty-two mother-infant pairs were selected for the substudy. Mother-infant pairs were stratified according to the mother's HIV (infected/uninfected) and secretor status (secretor/nonsecretor). HMOs in 4- and 28-d postpartum milk samples were analyzed by HPLC and compared between groups. Our results confirm previous reports that HIV-infected mothers have higher relative abundances of 3{$\prime$}-sialyllactose in their milk compared with HIV-uninfected mothers (10.7\% vs. 6.8\%; P {$<$} 0.01). Most intriguingly, the data also indicated that low concentrations of DSLNT in the 4-d milk samples in the mother's milk increased the infant's risk of NEC (200 \textpm{} 126 vs. 345 \textpm{} 186 {$\mu$}g/mL; P {$<$} 0.05), which is in accordance with results from previously published animal studies and warrants further investigation. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01868737.},
