  abstract = {Breast milk is the perfect nutrition for infants, a result of millions of years of evolution, finely attuning it to the requirements of the infant. Breast milk contains many complex proteins, lipids and carbohydrates, the concentrations of which alter dramatically over a single feed, as well as over lactation, to reflect the infant's needs. In addition to providing a source of nutrition for infants, breast milk contains a myriad of biologically active components. These molecules possess diverse roles, both guiding the development of the infants immune system and intestinal microbiota. Orchestrating the development of the microbiota are the human milk oligosaccharides, the synthesis of which are determined by the maternal genotype. In this review, we discuss the composition of breast milk and the factors that affect it during the course of breast feeding. Understanding the components of breast milk and their functions will allow for the improvement of clinical practices, infant feeding and our understanding of immune responses to infection and vaccination in infants.},

  abstract = {Gastrointestinal (GI)~microbiota composition differs between breastfed and formula-fed infants. Today's infant formulas are often fortified with prebiotics to better mimic properties of human milk with respect to its effect on GI microbiota composition and function. We used Illumina HiSeq sequencing of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments to investigate the composition of faecal microbiota in 2--12 week old infants receiving either breastmilk, infant formulas fortified with prebiotics, or mixed feeding. We compared these results with results from infants fed traditional formulas used in the Netherlands in 2002--2003, which contained no added prebiotics. We showed that today's formulas supplemented with either scGOS (0.24--0.50\,g/100\,ml) or scGOS and lcFOS (at a 9:1 ratio; total 0.6\,g/100\,ml) had a strong bifidogenic effect as compared to traditional formulas, and they also resulted in altered patterns of microbial colonisation within the developing infant gastrointestinal tract. We identified three microbial states (or developmental stages) in the first 12 weeks of life, with a gradual transition pattern towards a bifidobacteria dominated state. In infants receiving only fortified formulas, this transition towards the bifidobacteria dominated state was accelerated, whereas in infants receiving mixed feeding the transition was delayed, as compared to exclusively breastfed infants.},

  abstract = {The initial gut colonization of the infant plays a pivotal role in shaping the immune system, developing the intestinal tract, and influencing host metabolism, all of which are strongly influenced by several determinants, such as gestational age at birth, mode of delivery, neonatal feeding practices, early-life stress (ELS), and exposure to perinatal antibiotics. However, resulting gut microbiome (GM) dysbiosis may alter this developmental programming, leading to long-term adverse health outcomes. This narrative review synthesizes current knowledge on early-life GM development and its long-term impact on health. Specifically, it addresses how early-life GM dysbiosis may affect the trajectory of physiological processes, predisposing individuals to conditions such as allergic diseases, metabolic disorders, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disorders, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. In addition, it examines the influence of probiotic and prebiotic supplementation during pregnancy and early life in shaping infant GM composition, as well as the impact of ELS-induced GM dysbiosis on mental health. Recent research suggests that the early-life microbiota initiates long-lasting effects, and inadequate or insufficient microbial exposure triggers inflammatory responses associated with several physiological conditions. Although several studies have reported a connection between ELS and the GM during both prenatal and postnatal periods, a unified microbiome signature linked to either prenatal or postnatal stress remains to be fully elucidated. Thus, future studies are needed to establish causality and determine whether modifiable factors affecting the GM could be targeted to improve gut health, especially in children exposed to contextual stress or adverse conditions.},

  abstract = {Background Lipids in human milk (HM) provide the majority of energy for developing infants, as well as crucial essential fatty acids (FA). The FA composition of HM is highly variable and influenced by multiple factors. We sought to increase understanding of the variation in HMFA profiles and their development over the course of lactation, and after term and preterm delivery, using a pooled data analysis. Objective To review the literature and perform a pooled data analysis to qualitatively describe an extensive FA profile (36 FAs) in term and preterm colostrum, transitional - and mature milk up to 60 days postpartum. Design A Medline search was conducted for HMFA profile data following term or preterm delivery. The search was confined to English language papers published between January 1980 and August 2018. Studies reporting original data, extensive FA profiles in HM from healthy mothers were included. Weighted least squares (WLS) means were calculated from the pooled data using random or fixed effect models. Results Our pooled data analysis included data from 55 studies worldwide, for a total of 4374 term milk samples and 1017 preterm milk samples, providing WLS means for 36 FAs. Patterns in both term and preterm milk were apparent throughout lactation for some FAs: The most abundant FAs (palmitic, linoleic and oleic acid) remained stable over time, whereas several long-chain polyunsaturated FAs (including ARA and DHA) seemed to decrease and short- and medium-chain FAs increased over time. Conclusions High heterogeneity between individual studies was observed for the reported levels of some FAs, whereas other FAs were remarkably consistent between studies. Our pooled data suggests that specific FA categories fluctuate according to distinct patterns over the course of lactation; many of these patterns are comparable between term and preterm milk.},

When investigating the outcomes of child development, it is important to account for disparities in feeding practices and avoid confounding bias.To estimate the independent association between breastfeeding and attainment of developmental milestones or neurodevelopmental conditions.This retrospective cohort study used data from a national network for routine child development surveillance in Israel linked with national social insurance financial entitlements for neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Participants were children born between January 2014 and December 2020 after at least 35 weeks' gestation without severe morbidity and with at least 1 follow-up surveillance visit at 2 to 3 years of age. Outcome data were collected in March 2023.Duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding in infancy.The primary outcomes were delays in attainment of developmental milestones and diagnosis of prespecified neurodevelopmental conditions. Multivariable regression, matching, and within-family analyses were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) after accounting for potential confounding factors related to the child (gestational age, birth weight, multiple gestation, and child order in the family) and mother (age, socioeconomic status, educational level, marital status, employment, nationality, and postpartum depression).Of 570\,532 children (291\,953 [51.2\%] male), 20 642 (3.6\%) were preterm, 38\,499 (6.7\%) were small for gestational age, and 297\,571 (52.1\%) were breastfed for at least 6 months (123\,984 [41.7\%] were exclusively breastfed). Children who were breastfed for at least 6 months exhibited fewer delays in attaining language and social or motor developmental milestones compared with children exposed to less than 6 months of breastfeeding (AOR, 0.73 [95\% CI, 0.71-0.76] for exclusive breastfeeding; AOR, 0.86 [95\% CI, 0.83-0.88] for nonexclusive breastfeeding). Among 37\,704 sibling pairs, children who were breastfed for at least 6 months were less likely to demonstrate milestone attainment delays (OR, 0.91 [95\% CI, 0.86-0.97]) or be diagnosed with neurodevelopmental conditions (OR, 0.73 [95\% CI, 0.66-0.82]) compared with their sibling with less than 6 months of breastfeeding or no breastfeeding.In this cohort study, exclusive or longer duration of breastfeeding was associated with reduced odds of developmental delays and language or social neurodevelopmental conditions.

NCDs are increasing rapidly in high-income countries, but even more rapidly in some low-middle-income countries with insufficient resources to meet the challenge. Whilst not identified in the Millennium Development Goals, there is much attention paid to NCDs in the discussions at many levels on the Sustainable Development Goals, as they underpin economic, social and environmental development in the post-2015 era. In this article, we discuss how a life-course approach to health, commencing of necessity in early development, can provide new opportunities for addressing this challenge. The approach can leverage human health capital throughout life and across generations. New insights into mechanisms, especially those processes by which the developmental environment affects epigenetic processes in the developing offspring, offer the prospect of identifying biomarkers of future risks. New interventions to promote health literacy, lifestyle and physical fitness in adolescents, young adults and their children hold great promise. In this respect, health-care professionals concerned with preconceptional, pregnancy and newborn care will have a vital role to play.},

In the current study, we isolated a novel strain of Bifidobacterium kashiwanohense, named APCKJ1, from the faeces of a four-week old breastfed infant, based on the ability of the strain to utilise the HMO component fucosyllactose. We then determined the full genome sequence of this strain, and employed the generated data to analyze fucosyllactose metabolism in B. kashiwanohense APCKJ1. Transcriptomic and growth analyses, combined with metabolite analysis, in vitro hydrolysis assays and heterologous expression, allowed us to elucidate the pathway for fucosyllactose metabolism in B. kashiwanohense APCKJ1. Homologs of the key genes for this metabolic pathway were identified in particular in infant-derived members of the Bifdobacterium genus, revealing the apparent niche-specific nature of this pathway, and allowing a broad perspective on bifidobacterial fucosyllactose and L-fucose metabolism.},

  abstract = {Shotgun metagenomics studies have improved our understanding of microbial population dynamics and have revealed significant contributions of microbes to gut homeostasis. They also allow in silico inference of the metagenome. While they link the microbiome with metabolic abnormalities associated with disease phenotypes, they do not capture microbial gene expression patterns that occur in response to the multitude of stimuli that constantly ambush the gut environment. Metatranscriptomics closes that gap, but its implementation is more expensive and tedious. We assessed the metabolic perturbations associated with gut inflammation using shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. Shotgun metagenomics detected changes in abundance of bacterial taxa known to be SCFA producers, which favors gut homeostasis. Bacteria in the phylum Firmicutes were found at decreased abundance, while those in phyla Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were found at increased abundance. Surprisingly, inferring the coding capacity of the microbiome from shotgun metagenomics data did not result in any statistically significant difference, suggesting functional redundancy in the microbiome or poor resolution of shotgun metagenomics data to profile bacterial pathways, especially when sequencing is not very deep. Obviously, the ability of metatranscriptomics libraries to detect transcripts expressed at basal (or simply low) levels is also dependent on sequencing depth. Nevertheless, metatranscriptomics informed about contrasting roles of bacteria during inflammation. Functions involved in nutrient transport, immune suppression and regulation of tissue damage were dramatically upregulated, perhaps contributed by homeostasis-promoting bacteria. Functions ostensibly increasing bacteria pathogenesis were also found upregulated, perhaps as a consequence of increased abundance of Proteobacteria. Bacterial protein synthesis appeared downregulated. In summary, shotgun metagenomics was useful to profile bacterial population composition and taxa relative abundance, but did not inform about differential gene content associated with inflammation. Metatranscriptomics was more robust for capturing bacterial metabolism in real time. Although both approaches are complementary, it is often not possible to apply them in parallel. We hope our data will help researchers to decide which approach is more appropriate for the study of different aspects of the microbiome.},

  abstract = {Human breast milk (HBM) is essential for the infant's growth and development right after birth and is an irreplaceable source of nutrition for early human survival. Various infant formulas have many similarities to HBM in many components, but there is no perfect substitute for HBM. Recently, various breast milk components and their roles have been studied according to the development of various analysis techniques. As is already well known, HBM contains about 87\%--88\% water, and 124- g/L solid components as macronutrients, including about 7\% (60--70 g/L) carbohydrates, 1\% (8--10 g/L) protein, and 3.8\% (35--40 g/L) fat. The composition may vary depending on the environmental factors, including maternal diet. Colostrum is low in fat but high in protein and relatively rich in immuneprotective components. Although HBM contains enough vitamins to ensure normal growth of the infant, vitamins D and K may be insufficient, and the infant may require their supplementation. Growth factors in HBM also serve as various bioactive proteins and peptides on the intestinal tract, vasculature, nervous system, and endocrine system. In the past, HBM of a healthy mother was thought to be sterile. However, several subsequent studies have confirmed the presence of rich and diverse microbial communities in HBM. Some studies suggested that the genera \emph{Staphylococcus} and \emph{Streptococcus} may be universally predominant in HBM, but the origin of microbiota still remains controversial. Lastly, milk is the one of most abundant body fluid of microRNAs, which are known to play a role in various functions, such as immunoprotection and developmental programming, through delivering from HBM and absorption by intestinal epithelial cells. In conclusion, HBM is the most important source of nutrition for infants and includes microbiomes and miRNAs for growth, development, and immunity.},

  abstract = {About 20\%-25\% of Caucasian individuals are nonsecretors who fail to express soluble A, B, H, and Lewis b histo-blood group antigens in secretory organs and secretory fluids because of the absence of the Secretor gene (FUT2)-encoded alpha(1,2)-fucosyltransferase (Se enzyme) activity. Recently, the FUT2 and a pseudogene have been isolated, and an Se enzyme-deficient allele (se) caused by a nonsense mutation (G428A, se1) in Caucasians has also been reported. Although we were unable to find the se1 allele, we have found a missense mutation (A385T, se2) and two nonsense mutations (C571T, se3 and C628T, se4) in the Japanese Se enzyme-deficient alleles. In addition, we have found a fusion gene, which consisted of the 5'-region of the pseudogene and the 3'-region of the functional FUT2, as a Se enzyme-deficient allele (se5). The DNA sequence analysis of the fusion gene indicated that the crossover region corresponded to regions between bases 253 and 313 of the pseudogene and between bases 211 and 271 of the FUT2. This finding suggested that the fusion gene was generated by homologous but unequal crossover. A population study on 141 randomly selected Japanese has indicated that the se2 is a common Se enzyme-deficient allele in the Japanese population. The results suggest that Se enzyme-deficient alleles are race specific.},

  abstract = {Maternal diet may affect human milk macronutrients, but it remains to be elucidated whether this is also influential in infant growth. This study aimed to examine (1) how maternal diet influences human milk macronutrients, and (2) to what extent the variation in milk macronutrients affects infant growth during the first month of life. In 71 Japanese lactating women, maternal dietary information was collected from the brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire, and anthropometry of mother--infant dyads was collected from medical records. Macronutrients in milk were analyzed by a Human Milk Analyzer. Maternal retinol intake was associated with the carbohydrate content in human milk at 1-month postpartum (standardized {$\beta$} coefficient: 0.287; p = 0.038). Moreover, the energy content in human milk was associated with an increase in the weight standard deviation score based on the WHO growth standard at 1 month of age (standardized {$\beta$} coefficient: 0.399; p = 0.046). Nevertheless, the milk macronutrient was not associated with the risk of infant growth abnormalities. In conclusion, a part of the maternal diet impacts macronutrient contents in human milk, but milk macronutrients have a limited effect on infant growth only within the normal growth curve during the first month of life.},

  abstract = {Introduction The hormonal milieus of pregnancy and lactation are driving forces of nutrient fluxes supporting infant growth and development. The decrease of insulin sensitivity with compensatory hyperinsulinemia with advancing gestation, causes adipose tissue lipolysis and hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL). Subjects and methods We compared fatty acid (FA) contents and FA-indices for enzyme activities between preterm (28--36 weeks) and term (37--42) milks, and between colostrum (2--5 days), transitional (6--15) and mature (16--56) milks. We interpreted FA differences between preterm and term milks, and their changes with lactation, in terms of the well known decrease of insulin sensitivity during gestation and its subsequent postpartum restoration, respectively. Results Compared with term colostrum, preterm colostrum contained higher indices of DNL in the breast (DNL-breast) and medium chain saturated-FA (MCSAFA), and lower DNL-liver and monounsaturated-FA (MUFA). Preterm milk also had higher docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in colostrum and transitional milk and higher arachidonic acid (AA) in mature milk. Most preterm-term differences vanished with advancing lactation. In both preterm and term milks, DNL-breast and MCSAFA increased with advancing lactation, while DNL-liver, MUFA, long chain SAFA and AA decreased. DHA decreased in term milk. MUFA was inversely related to MCSAFA in all samples, correlated inversely with PUFA in colostrum and transitional milks, but positively in mature milk. MCSAFA correlated inversely with PUFA in mature milk. Conclusion Higher maternal insulin sensitivity at preterm birth may be the cause of lower MUFA (a proxy for DNL-liver) and higher MCSAFA (a proxy for DNL-breast) in preterm colostrum, compared with term colostrum. Restoring insulin sensitivity after delivery may be an important driving force for milk FA-changes in early lactation.},

Recent studies have indicated that Streptococcus mutans, Clostridium perfringens, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. However, the previous studies mainly focused on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. This study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. The prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. The screening assays identified 35 species with the ability to utilize lactulose, of which Cronobacter sakazakii, Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. In addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found. Thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of a breastfeeding promotion intervention on adiposity and BP at age 16 years and on longitudinal growth trajectories from birth. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cluster-randomized Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial. Belarusian maternity hospitals and affiliated polyclinics (the clusters) were allocated into intervention (n = 16) or control arms (n = 15) in 1996 and 1997. The trial participants were 17 046 breastfeeding mother-infant pairs; of these, 13 557 children (79.5\%) were followed up at 16 years of age between September 2012 and July 2015. INTERVENTIONS Breastfeeding promotion, modeled on the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared); fat and fat-free mass indices and percentage of body fat from bioimpedance; waist circumference; overweight and obesity; height; BP; and longitudinal growth trajectories. The primary analysis was modified intention-to-treat (without imputation for losses to follow-up) accounting for within-clinic clustering. RESULTS We examined 13 557 children at a median age of 16.2 years (48.5\% were girls). The intervention substantially increased breastfeeding duration and exclusivity compared with the control arm (exclusively breastfed: 45\% vs 6\% at 3 months, respectively). Mean differences at 16 years between intervention and control groups were 0.21 (95\% CI, 0.06-0.36) for BMI; 0.21 kg/m2 (95\% CI, -0.03 to 0.44) for fat mass index; 0.00 kg/m2 (95\% CI, -0.21 to 0.22) for fat-free mass index; 0.71\% (95\% CI, -0.32 to 1.74) for percentage body fat; -0.73 cm (-2.48 to 1.02) for waist circumference; 0.05 cm (95\% CI, -0.85 to 0.94) for height; -0.54 mm Hg (95\% CI, -2.40 to 1.31) for systolic BP; and 0.71 mm Hg (95\% CI, -0.68 to 2.10) for diastolic BP. The odds ratio for overweight/obesity (BMI 85th percentile vs {$<$}85th percentile) was 1.14 (95\% CI, 1.02-1.28) and the odds ratio for obesity (BMI 95th percentile vs {$<$}95th percentile) was 1.09 (95\% CI, 0.92-1.29). The intervention resulted in a more rapid rate of gain in postinfancy height (1 to 2.8 years), weight (2.8 to 14.5 years), and BMI (2.8 to 8.5 years) compared with the control arm. The intervention had little effect on BMI z score changes after 8.5 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A randomized intervention that increased the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding was not associated with lowered adolescent obesity risk or BP. On the contrary, the prevalence of overweight/obesity was higher in the intervention arm. All mothers initiated breastfeeding, so findings may not apply to comparisons of the effects of breastfeeding vs formula feeding.},

However, the factors shaping the development of the microbiota remain poorly understood, and the mechanisms through which these factors affect gut metabolite profiles have not been extensively investigated. Here we analyse gut microbiota development of 27 infants during the first month of life. We find three distinct clusters that transition towards Bifidobacteriaceae-dominant microbiota. We observe considerable differences in human milk oligosaccharide utilization among infant bifidobacteria. Colonization of fucosyllactose (FL)-utilizing bifidobacteria is associated with altered metabolite profiles and microbiota compositions, which have been previously shown to affect infant health. Genome analysis of infants' bifidobacteria reveals an ABC transporter as a key genetic factor for FL utilization. Thus, the ability of bifidobacteria to utilize FL and the presence of FL in breast milk may affect the development of the gut microbiota in infants, and might ultimately have therapeutic implications.},

  abstract = {Human milk (HM) provides essential nutrition for ensuring optimal infant growth and development postpartum. Metabolomics offers insight into the dynamic composition of HM. Studies have reported the impact of lactation stage, maternal genotype, and gestational age on HM metabolome. However, the majority of the studies have considered changes within the first month of lactation or sampled with large intervals. This leaves a gap in the knowledge of progressing variation in HM composition beyond the first month of lactation. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the HM metabolome from mothers with term deliveries varies beyond 1 month of lactation, during the period in which HM is considered fully mature. Human milk samples (n = 101) from 59 mothers were collected at weeks 1--2, 3--5, 7--9, and 20--25 postpartum and analyzed using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Several metabolites varied over lactation and exhibited dynamic changes between multiple time points. Higher levels of HM oligosaccharides, cis-aconitate, O-phosphocholine, O-acetylcarnitine, gluconate, and citric acid were observed in early lactation, whereas later in lactation, levels of lactose, 3-fucosyllactose, glutamine, glutamate, and shortand medium-chain fatty acids were increased. Notably, we demonstrate that the HM metabolome is dynamic during the period of maturity.},

  abstract = {There is much interest in the development of dietary supplements that selectively promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. The selectivity of many candidate prebiotics has, however, not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we evaluated stimulation of the human gut microbiota by the disaccharide lactulose using an ex vivo multimodal activity-based cell sorting approach. Incubation of human donor stool with lactulose resulted in growth or stimulation of a restricted diversity of bacterial genera, most prominently Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, and Lactococcus. Physiological analysis of lactulose-responsive strains isolated by Raman activated cell sorting revealed that most were capable of lactulose degradation. Among these isolates, Lactococcus lactis could not degrade lactulose, but its growth was boosted by co-cultivation with lactulose degraders. This suggests that inter-species facilitation contributes to the lactulose degradation niche. Moreover, we observed that lactulose selectively activates metabolically important taxa, including health-associated genera such as Faecalibacterium and Gemmiger1,2,3, potentially indicating broader functional effects beyond compositional changes. These results provide novel insights into the physiology and ecology of lactulose utilization by the human gut microbiota and underscore the potential of lactulose as a prebiotic dietary supplement.},

Dietary supplementation with MCFAs can improve metabolic features as well as cognition in humans. Some of the effects of MCFAs may be through direct receptor-mediated intracellular pathways, but MCFAs are also metabolic regulators that can alter circulating levels of hormones and metabolites, and hence may indirectly mediate body metabolism. Here we describe how dietary medium chain fatty acid, previously found to improve immune response and insulin secretion via G-protein coupled receptors, can increase apoptosis in cancer cells through the activation of the EGFR/ERK/AP1 transduction pathway. MCFA-enriched diets could therefore be used to manage metabolic diseases through the modification of gut microbiota, activation of GPR 40 and GPR 84.},

Among these compounds, human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) represent the third most important component of breastmilk after lipids and lactose. Several experiments demonstrated the beneficial effects of these components on the microbiota, the immune system and epithelial barriers, which are three major biological systems. Indeed, HMOs induce bacterial colonization in the intestinal tract, which is beneficial for health. The gut bacteria can act directly and indirectly on the immune system by stimulating innate immunity and controlling inflammatory reactions and by inducing an adaptive immune response and a tolerogenic environment. In parallel, HMOs directly strengthen the intestinal epithelial barrier, protecting the host against pathogens. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms of HMOs in these different compartments and highlight their potential use as new therapeutic agents, especially in allergy prevention.},

  abstract = {An extensive network of microbial-host interactions exists in the gut, making the gut microbiome a complex ecosystem to untangle. The microbial composition and the fecal metabolites are important readouts to investigate intricate microbiota-diet-host interplay. However, this ecosystem is dynamic, and it is of interest to understand the degree and timescale of changes occurring in the gut microbiota, during disease as well as in healthy individuals. Cross-sectional study design is often used to investigate the microbiome, but this design provides a static snapshot and cannot provide evidence on the dynamic nature of the gut microbiome. Longitudinal studies are better suited to extrapolate causation in a study or assess changes over time. This study investigates longitudinal change in the gut microbiome and fecal metabolites in 14~healthy individuals with weekly sampling over a period of one-month (four time points), to elucidate the temporal changes occurring in the gut microbiome composition and fecal metabolites. Utilizing 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing for microbiome analysis and NMR spectroscopy for fecal metabolite characterization, we assessed the stability of these two types of measurable parameters in fecal samples during the period of one month. Our results show that the gut microbiome display large variations between healthy individuals, but relatively lower within-individual variations, which makes it possible to uniquely identify individuals. The fecal metabolites showed higher stability over time compared to the microbiome and exhibited consistently smaller variations both within and between individuals. This relative higher stability of the fecal metabolites suggests a balanced, consistent output even amid individual's differences in microbial composition and they can provide a viable complementary readout to better understand the microbiome activity.},

However, there is a lack of consistency in the association between HMOs and benefits to infants' brains. Moreover, the quantification methods for HMOs have not yet been standardized. In this study, we developed a quantification method for evaluating eight HMOs (2{$\prime$}-fucosyllactose [2{$\prime$}-FL], 3{$\prime$}-fucosyllactose [3{$\prime$}-FL], 3{$\prime$}-sialyllactose [3{$\prime$}-SL], 6{$\prime$}-sialyllactose [6{$\prime$}-SL], lactosialyltetrasaccharide a [LSTa], lactosialyltetrasaccharide b [LSTb], lactosialyltetrasaccharide c [LSTc], and disialyllacto-N-tetraose [DSLNT]) in breast milk. After validating the method, we applied it to 1-month breast milk samples (n = 150) from the Tohoku Medical Megabank Project Birth and Three-Generation Cohort Study to assess HMO profiles in breast milk and their possible association with changes in head circumference z-score ({$\Delta$}HCZ) and neurodevelopmental scores of children (as measured by the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, Third Edition). The validation demonstrated that the method had relative standard deviation {$\leq$} 12.7\% of precision and 79.5--110.9\% of accuracy. Using this method, eight HMO levels (2{$\prime$}-FL, 0--4.74 mg/mL; 3{$\prime$}-FL, 0.02--1.52 mg/mL; 3{$\prime$}-SL, 0.07--0.32 mg/mL; 6{$\prime$}-SL, 0.01--0.70 mg/mL; LSTa, 0.002--0.043 mg/mL; LSTb, 0.02--0.31 mg/mL; LSTc, 0.001--0.47 mg/mL; and DSLNT, 0.09--0.71 mg/mL [min--max, all participants]) and the ratio of low secretors (16.0\%) in the Japanese cohort were obtained. The obtained HMO levels in breast milk were subjected to multivariate analysis to screen for HMOs showing a positive association with {$\Delta$}HCZ and neurodevelopmental scores. The results proposed that {$\Delta$}HCZ was positively associated with LSTb and 2{$\prime$}-FL levels, whereas neurodevelopmental scores were positively associated with 2{$\prime$}-FL levels (among all participants) and 3{$\prime$}-SL and DSLNT levels (among secretor participants). This study showed that the developed method provides HMO profiles in Japanese breast milk, as well as additional information on the associations between specific HMOs and neurodevelopment, reinforcing the sum of evidence for the role of HMOs in the brain.},

Variations in the composition and functional potential of the early-life microbiome are the result of lifestyle factors, such as mode of birth, breastfeeding, diet, and antibiotic usage. In addition, variations in the composition of the early-life microbiome have been associated with specific disease outcomes, such as asthma, obesity, and neurodevelopmental disorders. This points toward this bacterial consortium as a mediator between early lifestyle factors and health and disease. In addition, variations in the microbial intrauterine environment may predispose neonates to specific health outcomes later in life. A role of the microbiome in the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease is supported in this collective research. Highlighting the early-life critical window of susceptibility associated with microbiome development, we discuss infant microbial colonization, beginning with the maternal-to-fetal exchange of microbes in utero and up through the influence of breastfeeding in the first year of life. In addition, we review the available disease-specific evidence pointing toward the microbiome as a mechanistic mediator in the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease.},

These diverse compounds are thought to have numerous beneficial functions in infants, including protection against infectious diseases. The structures of more than 100 oligosaccharides in human milk have been elucidated so far.The aim of this review was to identify the main factors that affect the concentrations of oligosaccharides in human milk and to determine whether it is possible to calculate representative and reliable mean concentrations.A comprehensive literature search on oligosaccharide concentrations in human milk was performed in 6 electronic databases: BIOSIS, Current Contents Search, Embase, Lancet Titles, MEDLINE and PubMed.The initial search resulted in 1363 hits. After the elimination of duplicates, the literature was screened. The application of strict inclusion criteria resulted in 21 articles selected.Oligosaccharide concentrations, both mean values and single values, reported in the literature were sorted by gestational age, secretor status of mothers, and defined lactation periods.Mean concentrations, including confidence limits, of 33 neutral and acidic oligosaccharides reported could be calculated. Concentrations of oligosaccharides in human milk show variations that are dependent on both the secretor type of the mother and the lactation period as examined by analyses of variance. In addition, large interlaboratory variations in the data were observed.Worldwide interlaboratory quantitative analyses of identical milk samples would be required to identify the most reliable methods of determining concentrations of oligosaccharides in human milk. The data presented here contribute to the current knowledge about the composition and quantities of oligosaccharides in human milk and may foster greater understanding of the biological functions of these compounds.},

Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) were recently associated with HIV infection and transmission through breastfeeding and were also shown to reduce NEC in an animal model, particularly the HMO disialyllacto-N-tetraose (DSLNT). The primary aim of this study was to verify differences in HMO composition between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women. The secondary aim was to assess whether the HMO composition in the milk of mothers whose infants were diagnosed with NEC differs from that of mothers whose infants did not develop NEC. This study forms part of a larger clinical trial conducted at the Tygerberg Children's Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa, which recruited HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected mothers and their preterm infants ({$<$}34 wk gestation; {$\geq$}500 and {$\leq$}1250 g). Eighty-two mother-infant pairs were selected for the substudy. Mother-infant pairs were stratified according to the mother's HIV (infected/uninfected) and secretor status (secretor/nonsecretor). HMOs in 4- and 28-d postpartum milk samples were analyzed by HPLC and compared between groups. Our results confirm previous reports that HIV-infected mothers have higher relative abundances of 3{$\prime$}-sialyllactose in their milk compared with HIV-uninfected mothers (10.7\% vs. 6.8\%; P {$<$} 0.01). Most intriguingly, the data also indicated that low concentrations of DSLNT in the 4-d milk samples in the mother's milk increased the infant's risk of NEC (200 \textpm{} 126 vs. 345 \textpm{} 186 {$\mu$}g/mL; P {$<$} 0.05), which is in accordance with results from previously published animal studies and warrants further investigation. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01868737.},

  abstract = {The first 1, 000 days of life, from the fetal stage of a woman's pregnancy to 2 years of age after the baby is born, is a critical period for microbial colonization of the body and development of the immune system. The immune system and microbiota exhibit great plasticity at this stage and play a crucial role in subsequent development and future health. Two-way communication and interaction between immune system and microbiota is helpful to maintain human microecological balance and immune homeostasis. Currently, there is a growing interest in the important role of the microbiota in the newborn, and it is believed that the absence or dysbiosis of human commensal microbiota early in life can have lasting health consequences. Thus, this paper summarizes research advances in the establishment of the oral and intestinal microbiome and immune system in early life, emphasizing the substantial impact of microbiota diversity in the prenatal and early postnatal periods, and summarizes that maternal microbes, mode of delivery, feeding practices, antibiotics, probiotics, and the environment shape the oral and intestinal microbiota of infants in the first 1, 000 days of life and their association with the immune system.},
